# Handy warning message from prisma deploy:
# Warning: The `prisma generate` command was executed twice. 
# Since Prisma 1.31, the Prisma client is generated automatically after running `prisma deploy`. 
# It is not necessary to generate it via a `post-deploy`
# hook any more, you can therefore remove the hook if you do not need it otherwise.
